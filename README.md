**Delphi using Environment Variables in your App**

Environment Variables can help you extract data that require some in-depth
coding to achieve the same result. So here is a simple way to replace lengthy
legacy code or create some new code with

function GetEnvironmentVariable(const Name: string): string; found in the
*System.SysUtils* library.

**What it is?**

The ‘**GetEnvironmentVariable’** method is a way to retrieve the value of an
environment variable passed as a string (name) for the current process using a
standard list of Windows based variables that can be extracted.


Happy Coding
